## Instructions

This is a project for Udacity. This game is based on the classic arcade game: Frogger. To play the game please clone or download the repository linked below and open index.html in your chosen browser. Git repository at:

https://github.com/jamestownsend/fend-arcade-game

## How to play

To play the game, use the arrow keys to move the character around the map. To score the player must get to the water without being hit by any of the enemy bugs. Upon collision with a bug the screen will flash red, an alert will display and the player will be placed back the start of the map. If the player reaches the water without being hit by an enemy then a point will be added to the score and the player will be reset at the start.

## Dependencies

For this game to run, the user must use a browser that is able to run JavaScript effectively.

## Contributing

This repository has been built of the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Code has been written of the basic structure with customisations made to the styling to add to personalisation.
